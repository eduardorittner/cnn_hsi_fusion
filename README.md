# Objective

This repo is intends to modify the architectures used in caiyuanhao1998's [repo](https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/MST-plus-plus) so they perform MSI and HSI fusion instead of MSI -> HSI spectral recovery.

# Dataset

The dataset is divided into training [spectral](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FQBfDd248dCKClR-BpX5V2drSbeyhKcq/view) and [RGB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A4GUXhVc5k5d_79gNvokEtVPG290qVkd/view) images, validation [spectral](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12QY8LHab3gzljZc3V6UyHgBee48wh9un/view) and [RGB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19vBR_8Il1qcaEZsK42aGfvg5lCuvLh1A/view) images and testing [RGB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A5309Gk7kNFI-ORyADueiPOCMQNTA7r5/view) images without the corresponding spectral results.
